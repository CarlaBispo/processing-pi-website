The many [Libraries for Processing] will generally just work on the
Raspberry Pi. Below is a list of a few that Raspberry Pi users might
find useful:

 

- [GL Video] - for hardware-accelerated video playback
- [Simple Touch] - for using touchscreen displays
- [Simple Receipt Printer] - for using Serial-port-attached thermal
printers
- [Upload to Pi] - a tool for uploading sketches onto Pi computers
remotely from another machine
- [Hardware I/O] - will run in emulation mode on other OS
 

All of these are available to install through Processing's *Contribution
Manager*.
