The port of Processing to the ARM architecture has been developed by [Gottfried Haider](https://twitter.com/mrgohai) since 2015. It has been supported by a Google Summer of Code fellowship in 2015 and a Processing Foundation fellowship in 2017, both times mentored by [Ben Fry](http://benfry.com/).

This website was developed by [Maks Surguy](https://twitter.com/msurguy), who also contributed the tutorials during his Google Summer of Code fellowship in 2018. Both greatly improved the project's accessibility.
